<p>For over 80 years, we have made research the core of everything we do at Himalaya. From 1930, we have been at the forefront of herbal research, developing widely prescribed phytopharmaceuticals like Liv.52, Cystone and Septilin. Under our pharmaceutical banner, we also have a dedicated pediatric portfolio with products like Bonnisan and Bonnispaz, herbal formulations for the treatment of indigestion and colic. Backed by over 200 clinical studies, the range is prescribed by pediatricians across the country. The products have become household names and are widely trusted by mothers.<br> <br>

Our understanding of herbs that work best for children’s internal health has helped us to develop a range of baby products that are just right for your baby’s topical wellness.<br><br>

Research tells us that the lower layers of a baby’s skin are not fully developed, and the oil-secreting glands will not be active until they reach the age of ten. As a result, baby’s skin tends to dehydrate more quickly, causing dryness and irritation. Baby’s skin is also less immune to bacterial infections and allergies and is prone to flakiness, diaper rash, baby acne and sunburn.<br><br>

Because baby’s skin is that much thinner, it is also extremely vulnerable to irritants. Residue chemicals and harmful ingredients in baby care products are immediately absorbed by their skin. These chemicals can seriously damage your baby’s eyes and ears.<br><br>

At Himalaya, the science of baby care is geared towards bringing the very best of natural care for the most precious person in your life. Our science of baby care is backed by a strong team of scientists who have carefully selected time-tested herbal ingredients for our Baby Care range. The products have been developed, keeping in mind the special requirements of baby’s skin. They are clinically tested to ensure safety and efficacy. So, when you choose Himalaya for your little one, you can be rest assured that you are choosing the very best!</p>
